## Hi there, I'm Mike. ðŸ‘‹
I am a .NET developer and IT Systems Administrator for Linux, Windows, and vmWare appliances with a passion for building solutions to solve our every day problems and increase quality of life with technology. I currently lead the [Everneth SMP Community](https:/everneth.com) and its small development team in the [Everneth GitHub organization](https://github.com/Everneth). I enjoy working with Discord bots and building Minecraft (Java edition) plugins to solve problems and automate processes to increase the ease of running our community everyday. Below, in no particular order, are the technologies I use the most in my work and my hobby development.
